# Question

Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a special form. “Why
can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she asks.
Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a
new version of if:

    (define (new-if predicate
                    then-clause
                    else-clause)
      (cond (predicate then-clause)
            (else else-clause)))

# Answer

The program doesnt run because in this case, the new-if function is not using
normal order evaluation, but application order, normaly if uses normal order,
given that the third pedricate involves the function calling sqrt-iter, which
then calls new-if again, what we have is an infinite loop of new-if calling
itself.
