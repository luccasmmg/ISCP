# Question

Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is
faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation.
He defines the following two procedures:

    (define (p) (p))
    
    (define (test x y)
      (if (= x 0)
          0
          y))

Then he evaluates the expression

    (test 0 (p))

# Answer

In application order evaluation, you first substitute every variable to the
primitive operand, than when you do that you can compute, normal order
evaluation on the other hand, only substitute a value when it is needed.
Therefore in an application order evaluation, the program will crash imediatly,
because the first thing it will do is try to define what primitive operand p is,
but given that it expands indefinetly, it will never come with a result.
Normal order on the other hand, you only try to do that, when it actually needs
the value of p, but given that x equals 0, the program will compute 0 on the
screen, before it needs p, it would only need p if x was different from 0.
